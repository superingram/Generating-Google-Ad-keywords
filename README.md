# Generating-Google-Ad-keywords

Imagine working for a digital marketing agency, which is approached by a massive online retailer of furniture. Here, we are tasked with creating a prototype set of keywords for search campaigns for their sofas section. We will utilize Python to efficiently create these keywords!
